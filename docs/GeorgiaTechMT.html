    TECHNICAL PURSUITS
1. SubSpectralNet: During my internship at NUS, I proposed a novel CNN which leverages certain properties of audio spectrograms. I led this project under the supervision of Dr. Emmanouil Benetos and Prof. Wang Ye.
2. CS4347 Lecture: Being one of the TAs of the course Sound and Music Computing, I gave a lecture on my research and CNNs to the B.Tech. students at NUS.
3. Multi-level DCNets: Worked on this project out of my own interests during my bachelor's. I read a paper on Capsule Networks and I had an idea to improve over this work. I approached a Ph.D. scholar at IIT Ropar and our work got published in ACCV 2018 (equal co-authors).
4. The One Man Show: Being a musician, I want to record myself playing multiple instruments and my vocals and produce a final video. This app takes multiple audios/videos in sync and creates an intelligent mashup using AI.

MUSICAL PURSUITS
1. Child's Play: My composition
2. NUS Guitar Ensemble: Performed in an ensemble concert at NUS
